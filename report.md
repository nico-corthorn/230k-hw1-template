## HW1 solution

(include names)

Should contain all plots, tables, and analysis requested in the instructions of the homework. You can alternative write the report in an ipynb file, but mind you that merge conflicts will happen more often. Maybe the best of both worlds is to leave plots and tables in the notebook with minimal code imported from modules?
